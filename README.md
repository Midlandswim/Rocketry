# Rocketry Projekts
Work for AstroKnights and Personal Rocketry Projekts

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and the BCA AstroKnights <br />
Advisor: Mr. Joesph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Eric Paul (BCA) & Mr. Victor Samarakone <br />
Context: The Bergen County Academies' AstroKnights Competitive Rocketry Team and Personal Projekts <br />
Projekt Name: General Rocketry Projekts <br />
Start Date: September 30, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. This repository has two different projects together, under the same theme of rocketry. The first part is my work with the Bergen County Academies' competitive rocketry team, the AstroKnights, and the second part is my personal work with model rocketry. The Astroknights competed in the Battle of Rockets Rocketry Competition in Culpeper, Virginia. We went to actually place 2nd out of 47 teams nationally for Documents. Sadly, we were unable to go to the competition due to school travel restructions related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. I was eventually promoted to Build Team Captain, and would serve as one of the lead engineers in design of the Rocket and motor work. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
